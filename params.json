The recording is initiated by calling captureKeySequence() or\r\nthe user clicking into the widget. \r\n\r\nThe QKeySequenceWidget is based on code KKeySequenceWidget from KDE project.\r\nBut it not needs kde libraries for building and working.\r\n\r\n## Usage:\r\n\r\nFor using QKeySequenceWidget in your qmake-based project you must copy  \r\n\"qkeysequencewidget\" directory to your source tree. And include \r\nqkeysequencewidget.pri into your *.pro file.\r\n\r\nFor example see projects in \"demos\" directoy .\r\n\r\nFor using QKeySequenceWidget in your CMake-based project you must coy  \r\n\"qkeysequencewidget\" directory to your source tree. And include into main \r\nCMakeLists.txt this strings:\r\n\r\n    add_subdirectory(\"path/to/qkeysequencewidget/\")\r\n    include_directories(\"path/to/qkeysequencewidget/src\")\r\n\r\nThen add \"qkeysequencewidget\" into target_link_libraries section for your project.\r\n\r\nFor example, see CmakeLists.txt in current directoy.\r\n\r\nFor using QKeySequenceWidget in QtDesigner you needs build designer-plugin. \r\nThis located in \"designer-plugin\" directory. \r\n\r\n    qmake\r\n    make\r\n\r\nInstalling QKeySeqenceWidgetPlughin^\r\n\r\nOn Linux:\r\n\r\n    make install (as root)\r\n\r\nOn Windows:\r\n\r\n    Copy QKeySequnceWidgetPlugin.dll to ${QT_DIR}/plugins/designer\r\n\r\nIt builded only qmake, CMake not supported.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Artem Galichkin <doomer3d@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nLicence: BSD"}
